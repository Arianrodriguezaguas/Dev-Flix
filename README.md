<h2>This project I learned at <a href="https://rodofomori.com.br/devclub">DevClub</a> Created using REACT It is so far the most complex project I have worked on. In this case we reviewed how to consume different information from an API, making it update automatically, we also learned how to organize the code to make it look more professional. It was a good challenge.</h2>
